🌦️ Live Weather Dashboard

🧭	Project Overview
      			The Live Weather Dashboard is a web application that provides real-time weather updates for any location around the world. Users can search for cities and view current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecasts. The app integrates with a weather API to fetch live data and presents it through a clean, interactive, and responsive UI.
💡Goal:
To create an intuitive platform where users can easily monitor weather conditions and forecasts in real time with visually appealing charts and icons.

🚀	Features
1.	Real-Time Weather Data – Fetches live weather updates using an external API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).
2.	City Search Functionality – Users can search by city name or use geolocation to fetch local weather.
3.	5-Day Forecast – Displays upcoming weather predictions with temperature trends.
4.	Interactive UI – Beautiful data visualization with weather icons, temperature graphs, and color-coded conditions.
5.	Unit Conversion – Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
6.	Responsive Design – Fully functional on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
